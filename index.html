        <p>Notes</p>
        <p>Storage: Store the chia pudding in a mason jar or Tupperware for up to 1 week in the fridge.</p>
        <p>Freezer Instructions: You can freeze the chia seed pudding for up to 3 months in individual servings. Use freezer-safe ziplock bags or small mason jar containers. To thaw, just place in the fridge overnight.</p>
        <p>Substitutes: For best results, follow the recipe as is. However here are some common substitutes that would work well in this recipe.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Instead of plant-based milk, you can use regular milk or coconut water or regular water.</li>
            <li>Instead of maple syrup, you can use honey or any other sweetener of choice. You can also skip the sweetener.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Sourcing: You can find chia seeds at all major grocery stores. It's usually in the bulk section or with the cereal or superfoods. You can find matcha powder in the coffee and tea section.</p>
        <p>Product Reference: I use these mini tulip shaped jelly jars when I make chia pudding. The chia pudding fills up about half the jar, leaving room for toppings.</p>
